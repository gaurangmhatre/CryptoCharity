## Description
We face common problem of corruption with many charity organizations and the donors are worrying about many things like how my money is being use? For what purposes are money used?Have I donated at the correct charity where there is actual need?Can I donate at better place?. This happens mainly because there is no clarity of each transaction that happens after the charity amount is paid to organization, causing chaos and mistrust issues in the society.

We built a project using ibm bluemix block-chain that can record the transactional flow of where money goes and how it is used. As block-chain provides decentralized system having properties of security and transparency , this project would help in achieving less corruption and more integrity, therefore, promote the philanthropy all over the world!
