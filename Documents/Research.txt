3> Smart - Contracts:
    Smart Contracts are operations that are to be executed on Ethereum to perform some transactions. 
    Smart contracts have the logic written for executing operations.
4> Current Development Options available:

    Solidicty is used as one of the ways to implement smart Contracts in Ethereum.
    Meteor is a javascript frameworkd used to create user interface to interact with Ethereum.
    Truffle is another which is used to linking , deploying , creating smart contracts.
    Geth client with Go language.
    Embark framework.
    web3 as a middleware for interacting with Ethereum platform

    - Embark : Requirements : geth ethereum client , node js and npm , Solidicty (solc)
                for Dapp js front end developement

    - Truffle : Requirements : metamask , truffle

    - Mist : Its a broswer for running ethereum applications. It also supports ethereum wallets and contracts. It has inbuild geth and web3.js.

    - Ethereum clients : 1> geth for go ethereum 2> cpp-Ethereum for c++ 3> pyethereum for python

    - Meteor : GETH client , WEB3 tointact with ethereum blockchain

5> IBM Bluemix : IBM Bluemix Blockchain service provided a platform to develop blockchain applications.
Chaincode is the code used as a smart contract to interact with blockchain - hyperledger in terms of Bluemix
Chaincode is a golang code.
